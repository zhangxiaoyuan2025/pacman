                <h2>About Geometry Dash</h2>
                <p>Geometry Dash is an addictive rhythm-based action platformer game that challenges players to navigate colorful geometric shapes through a series of increasingly difficult obstacle courses. Set to a pulsing electronic soundtrack, each level in Geometry Dash is synchronized with the music, making timing your jumps and movements crucial to success. The game's simple one-touch gameplay mechanic belies its deep complexity and steep difficulty curve, which has made it a favorite among casual players seeking a challenge and hardcore gamers alike. With its vibrant graphics, precision-based gameplay, and ear-catching music, Geometry Dash delivers an exhilarating experience that keeps players coming back for "just one more try."</p>
                
                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <p>The controls for Geometry Dash are deceptively simple but require perfect timing and practice to master:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On desktop: Click the mouse or press the spacebar/up arrow key to jump</li>
                    <li>On mobile: Tap the screen to jump</li>
                    <li>Hold the button/screen to continuously jump when playing certain vehicle segments</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The goal is to guide your character (a small geometric shape) through a level filled with spikes, obstacles, and platforms. Your character moves automatically from left to right, and you must time your jumps carefully to avoid obstacles. Touching any obstacle results in instant death and forces you to restart the level from the beginning. The game features multiple game modes where your character transforms into different vehicles with unique mechanics, such as a ship that can fly up and down, a ball that changes gravity, a UFO that makes constant hops, a wave that moves like a sine wave, and a robot that can make high and low jumps.</p>
                
                <h3>Game Features</h3>

                    <li><strong>Hard:</strong> Challenging levels that require good timing and familiarity with the game</li>
                    <li><strong>Harder:</strong> Very challenging levels with complex sequences and obstacle placement</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The game's difficulty curve is steep, with later levels requiring hundreds of attempts even from skilled players. The satisfaction of finally completing a challenging level is a major part of the game's appeal.</p>
                
                <h3>Game Modes</h3>
                <p>Throughout your Geometry Dash adventure, your character will transform into different forms, each with unique gameplay mechanics:</p>

                    <li><strong>Robot:</strong> Similar to the cube but can make high or low jumps depending on how long you hold the button</li>
                    <li><strong>Spider:</strong> Teleports between ceiling and floor when tapped, requiring precise timing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many levels feature multiple mode changes, requiring you to quickly adapt to different control mechanics while maintaining your rhythm.</p>
                
                <h3>Level Elements</h3>
                <p>Geometry Dash includes various interactive elements that affect gameplay:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jump Pads and Rings:</strong> Automatically propel your character upward or in specific directions</li>
                    <li><strong>Gravity Portals:</strong> Flip gravity, allowing your character to travel on the ceiling</li>
                    <li><strong>Size Portals:</strong> Shrink or enlarge your character, affecting how it interacts with obstacles</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed Portals:</strong> Change the game speed, from very slow to extremely fast</li>
                    <li><strong>Dual Portals:</strong> Control two characters simultaneously, doubling the challenge</li>

                    <li><strong>Teleportation Portals:</strong> Instantly move your character to a different part of the level</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These elements combine to create increasingly complex and challenging level designs as you progress through the game.</p>
                
                <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use Practice Mode to learn difficult sections by placing checkpoints</li>
                    <li>Focus on memorizing obstacle patterns rather than trying to react in real-time</li>
                    <li>Turn on the metronome in settings to help with rhythm and timing</li>
                    <li>Watch replays of successful attempts by other players for strategies</li>
                    <li>Start with easier levels to develop your skills before tackling harder ones</li>
                    <li>Try to stay calm during difficult sections - tension can lead to mistakes</li>
                    <li>For precise timing, listen to the music as many obstacles are synchronized with the beat</li>
                    <li>Take breaks if you find yourself getting frustrated with a particular level</li>
                </ul>
